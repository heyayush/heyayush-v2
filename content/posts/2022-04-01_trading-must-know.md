### Option Chain for direction prediction

Open Interest is number of contracts.
Change in open Interest is the number of contracts added today.

### Sign of recession

10 year interest rate is lesser than 2 year interest rate. Because generally long term interest rates are higher than short term interest rates.

### Vix

If vix is high then it is good for option sellers.

Low quantity of underlying option data
If there is very less quantity of data then market should go trending instead of range bound. Because new data is awaiting on the sidelines to get deployed and as the trend starts to develop the positions will be made as per that trend. That's why we say trend is our friend.

As a second check we should see the market breadth as well. If there are high number of advances as compared to declines and underlying data is low and on verge of breakout then higher chances that it will breakout. Similarly on the bearish side.

### Bottom prediction

If the recovery coming from lows is faster than the fall then bottom is near. For example if 300 point fall takes 5 hours and then 200-250 point is recovered in 1 hour.
