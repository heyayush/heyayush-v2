### Option Chain for direction prediction

Open Interest is number of contracts.
Change in open Interest is the number of contracts added today.

### Sign of recession

10 year interest rate is lesser than 2 year interest rate. Because generally long term interest rates are higher than short term interest rates.

### Vix

If vix is high then it is good for option sellers.

Low quantity of underlying option data
If there is very less quantity of data then market should go trending instead of range bound. Because new data is awaiting on the sidelines to get deployed and as the trend starts to develop the positions will be made as per that trend. That's why we say trend is our friend.

As a second check we should see the market breadth as well. If there are high number of advances as compared to declines and underlying data is low and on verge of breakout then higher chances that it will breakout. Similarly on the bearish side.

### Bottom prediction

If the recovery coming from lows is faster than the fall then bottom is near. For example if 300 point fall takes 5 hours and then 200-250 point is recovered in 1 hour.
Bottom gets formed very fast and if you keep on waiting for that price to come so that you can buy then it won't come that is the proof that bottom is made.

Big candles and sharp movements show fresh buying or selling and must be given more importance. So find out the areas of fresh buying or selling and plan your trade accordingly.
This big candles if broken then can give good momentum. If it was fresh buying candle and then a closing comes below it then fresh selling can come and give good momentum on downside. Similarly for Seller's zone if breakout can give good short covering.

When there is a good short covering move then trapped CE sellers sell ATM PE to manage their positions. And due to upmove PE premiums go down. A time comes that stock price moves up still PE premiums do not decrease that is the time slowly the upward momentum stops and option writers look for oportunity to sell CE because PE premiums are too low.

Trading around the big IPO listings can be tricky. For example LIC IPO was big and it listed lower than issue price around 10% discount. So I was expecting that it will have negative impact on market sentiment and market will tumble but it shoot up because of short covering. Point to note is that the money which was blocked by IPO freed up. Overall market cap increased as big money entered in market. And LIC got so much cash with this IPO which they may invest in market thus causing market to rise.

In bear market if you see morning breakout then more chances that it is false.

If market starts ignoring bad news then bottom is mostly likely made.
