## Godfather

- Don't allow people to disrespect you.
- Family matters a lot. Don't ever take sides with anyone against your family.
- _"A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man."_
- Don't publically expose your weaknesses/disagreements.
- _"Why don't you come to me first?"_

Don't let people take you as option, be the priority.

- _`it's not personal. It's strictly business.`_

Keep personal and professional life separate.

- > Don't tell me you are innocent. Because it insults my intelligence.

Let people know that they can't fool you.

- "Great men are not born great. They grow great."
- "I'll make him an offer he can't refuse."
