## Tax understanding

What are the taxable incomes?

### Dividend

TDS is deducted on dividend paid which is 10% if that company is paying more than 5000. Gets added to your income and have to pay tax as per your slab.

### Short term capital gain

15%. Loss can settled with other short term or else long term. Losses can be carried forward till 8 years.

### Long term capital gain

10% and only on income above 1 Lakh. Loss can be settled with other long term. Losses can be carried forward till 8 years.

### Intraday Cash market

Comes under speculative income.

### Tax Loss Harvesting

You can book unrealized losses in the month of march so that they compensate for the gains and hence there is less net realized profit for that year, thus need to pay less tax.

### Futures and Options

### ITR-3

Salary as well as Business.
Futures and Options trading and Intraday Trades comes under business and not capital gains.

FnO come under Business section.
Go for 13018- Other financial intermediation services.
Add a new field in no account cases.
Intraday comes under speculative activity.
FnO that is Busines section will not allow Profit with minus sign. So can't enter loss in that. But in Speculative activity that is intraday we can enter losses as well with minus sign in front.

Short term under 111A
Long term under 112A

### ITR-2

When you have Salary as well as "Sale of securities and units of mutual fund" and "Purchase of securities and units of mutual funds" shown in you TIS/AIS then ITR-1 is not the way to go. Now we need to file ITR-2.
So for cash delivery of equity and mutual funds ITR-2 is the way to go.
But if you want to add Intraday and FnO as well then go for ITR-3.
Income from selling a property will also add in ITR-2
Foreign income and foreign assets.
Income from agriculture exceeds 5000 Rs.

From AY 2022-23 audit limit increased upto 10 Cr

Books of account mandatory if turnover crosses 10Cr. 44-A

Tax Audit
44-AB Tax audit applicability.

Business loss cannot be set-off against salary income. Loss can be carry forward.
If turnover is more than 10Cr than audit is mandatory.
44-AD ko no karna hai because this is applicable if person was filing ITR-4 earlier and showing presumptive tax.

If claiming loss or carry forward loss than say yes I maintain books of account and make a balance sheet.
