## Coal

India do need coal for next few decades. 75% electricity demand is currently met by coal and India do have a huge coal reserve.
Lot's of environment awareness on coal causing pollution but reality is that with proper gasification and technology, there is negligible to zero pollution.

## Metals mining

Huge multifold growth in metals mining specially Lithium, Nickel, Cobalt, Copper, Zinc. 1000 % - 2000 % we just don't know how big growth is there depending on EV and battery storage needs. Since these are rare earth metals, the limited supply and mining concerns are causing huge shortfall in demand in this segment. Automobile industry is also suffering due to this.

Iron ore, coking coal are raw materials for steel but their prices are directly co-related if demand of steel goes down then iron-ore required is less and its price goes down as well.

## Energy

- Shift from petrol/diesel to renewable energy.
- Electricity demand to shoot up heavily in the future.
- Migration from petrol to EV disrupted automobile industry.

## Inflation

Supply side inflation is generally not that sustainable as compared to demand side inflation.
For example real state prices increases because cement, steel prices are increasing not because there is more demand for houses.

## Real Estate

- Over the last 5 years, salary has increased more as compared to the cost of property. Hence now the buyer has the ability to shell out some more money for buying property and hence we may see increase in property prices in coming years.
- Home loans are at minimum rate. NPA in home loan is lowest in the world and hence is the safest lending option and hence high competition among banks for home loans. Inflation is 5% so if home loan is 6.5% then basically you are just paying 1.5% interest and if you are taking income tax benefit of that then virtually it is 0% interest. It seems as if borrowing for free without paying any interest.
- Building material cost is increasing thus property prices is expected to increase.
- Culture of work from home and increasing sentiment towards personal space demanding separate rooms from every individual is promoting larger homes.
- Registration revenue figures from various state govt showing increase in month on month basis, showing that more property transactions are taking places. Also cut in stamp duty by govt makes it lucrative to buy property.

## Technology

- Govt. looking to upgrade manual system to automatic and data driven, so lots of upcoming contracts for IT industry.

## Automobiles

- Developed nation is not the one where poor can afford personal vehicles but the one where rich also prefers public transport.
- Commodity price rises such as aluminium, copper, nickel, zinc, steel, lithium, graphite have a negative impact.
- Mandatory air bags also hurting low budget car sales.

## Green Hydrogen

- Making India global hub for the production and export of green hydrogen.
- Reduce emission of green house gases thus addressing pollution and climate concerns.

## Diamonds

India imports rough diamonds from many countries especially Russia, Africa and then polish those diamonds and export it. Surat diamond industry is huge and India is exporting in big numbers.

## Indian Railway

- Cargo business is not proving much profits due to higher operating costs. Need to focus on creating infrastructure for small customers that is non-bulk freight as well.
- Coal makes a big portion of railway freight followed by cement, fertilizers, petroleum products, foodgrains.
- Road Transport of goods is much more than Railway transport.
- Bulk transports have well defined origin and destination however small parcels can origin from and land at any place, hence the need of infrastructure to accomodate this segment.
- Need of proper loading and unloading process and infra.

## Diagnosis Industry

- Rationalization of prices is going on.
- In last decade the growth is on the basis of increase in volume. Now the industry is trying to be more efficient and enter into B2C segment.

## India Imports

- Crude Oil
- Gold
- Ammonia
- Crude Palm Oil from Indonesia and Malaysia.
- Coal is also imported dispite India having huge reserves because of lack of infrastructure to mine it.

## India Exports

- Software Services
- Pharmacy
- Wheat (second biggest producer in the world)
- Rice
- Tea
- Diamond
- Petroleum products made from imported crude oil are exported to countries like UAE, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mauritious, Africa.

## Indian States

### Madhya Pradesh

- First rank among states in Soybean production.
- Rice is produced in 34% of total cultivated area. Mostly in eastern MP.
- Second in cement production. 14% of country.
- Fourth in the production of minerals and coal.
- Manganese is found in Chhindwara and Balaghat.
- Diamond in Panna and Mjhgaon (Satna).
- Major producer of Coal, Limestone, Copper, Diaspore and Pyrophyllite.
- Opium is produced around Mandsaur area.

### Karnataka

- Leading state in coffee production.

### Jammu & Kashmir

- Apples.
- Flowers.

## Countries

### China

- Biggest consumer of metals, steel.
-

### Belarus

- Top supplier of Potash. Used in agriculture fertilisers.
-

### America

- Corn is the major feedstock to produce bio-ethanol.
-

## Gold

- Tends to be in demand during geopolitical or economical crisis. Basically the times when paper currency is under threat.
-

## Some concepts

### Inverted duty structure

Phenomenon when taxes on raw materials is higher so locally manufactured products are costlier and hence importing that product is a better option.

Tolling: Transporting coal is costlier than transporting electricity hence power plants near the coal mines will take nearby coal, generate electricity and then transport it.
Lack of containers to transport coal by railways.
Tussle between center and non BJP states on clearing env and land acquisitions resulting in delays.
New policy to allow building infrastructure on land allocated for coal mining so that projects utilising coal can be setup on the site instead of transporting coal to distant plants.

Decline of tea production in Sri Lanka is an opportunity for India.

### Economy Recovery Signs

- Increase in capacity utilisation is a good sign of natural growth in economy.

### Black Swan Event

- Extreamely rare.
- Impact is severe.
