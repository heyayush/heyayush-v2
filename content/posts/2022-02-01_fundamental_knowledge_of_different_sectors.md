## Coal

India do need coal for next few decades. 75% electricity demand is currently met by coal and India do have a huge coal reserve.
Lot's of environment awareness on coal causing pollution but reality is that with proper gasification and technology, there is negligible to zero pollution.

## Metals mining

Huge multifold growth in metals mining specially Lithium, Nickel, Cobalt, Copper, Zinc. 1000 % - 2000 % we just don't know how big growth is there depending on EV and battery storage needs. Since these are rare earth metals, the limited supply and mining concerns are causing huge shortfall in demand in this segment. Automobile industry is also suffering due to this.

## Energy

- Shift from petrol/diesel to renewable energy.
- Electricity demand to shoot up heavily in the future.
- Migration from petrol to EV disrupted automobile industry.

## Inflation

Supply side inflation is generally not that sustainable as compared to demand side inflation.
For example real state prices increases because cement, steel prices are increasing not because there is more demand for houses.

## Real Estate

- Over the last 5 years, salary has increased more as compared to the cost of property. Hence now the buyer has the ability to shell out some more money for buying property and hence we may see increase in property prices in coming years.
- Home loans are at minimum rate. NPA in home loan is lowest in the world and hence is the safest lending option and hence high competition among banks for home loans. Inflation is 5% so if home loan is 6.5% then basically you are just paying 1.5% interest and if you are taking income tax benefit of that then virtually it is 0% interest. It seems as if borrowing for free without paying any interest.
- Building material cost is increasing thus property prices is expected to increase.
- Culture of work from home and increasing sentiment towards personal space demanding separate rooms from every individual is promoting larger homes.
- Registration revenue figures from various state govt showing increase in month on month basis, showing that more property transactions are taking places. Also cut in stamp duty by govt makes it lucrative to buy property.

## Automobiles

- Developed nation is not the one where poor can afford personal vehicles but the one where rich also prefers public transport.
- Commodity price rises such as aluminium, copper, nickel, zinc, steel, lithium, graphite have a negative impact.
- Mandatory air bags also hurting low budget car sales.

## Green Hydrogen

- Reduce emission of green house gases thus addressing pollution and climate concerns.

-

## Some concepts

### Inverted duty structure

Phenomenon when taxes on raw materials is higher so locally manufactured products are costlier and hence importing that product is a better option.

Tolling: Transporting coal is costlier than transporting electricity hence power plants near the coal mines will take nearby coal, generate electricity and then transport it.
Lack of containers to transport coal by railways.
Tussle between center and non BJP states on clearing env and land acquisitions resulting in delays.
New policy to allow building infrastructure on land allocated for coal mining so that projects utilising coal can be setup on the site instead of transporting coal to distant plants.

Decline of tea production in Sri Lanka is an opportunity for India.
