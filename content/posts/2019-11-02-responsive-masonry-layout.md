**Do you know what is the name of this layout?**
![Masonry Layout](/media/masonry.png 'Masonry Layout')

Sometimes knowing the correct name helps a lot in solving the problem, because googling with correct name can give the results we need.  
I was creating a layout with list of items of uneven height and width and handling the dynamic list of such items and making sure it is responsive needs a bit of both CSS and JS.  
After many hours I was finally able to achieve it but then I came to know the name that it is called **Masonry Layout**.

And googling with Masonry layout I got ready to use lib code with which this can be achieved in minutes with ease.

I picked [Colcade](https://github.com/desandro/colcade) which was apt for my need and within minutes the layout was looking good.

Here's the beautiful [Preview](https://css-tricks.netlify.com/layouts/Masonry/)
