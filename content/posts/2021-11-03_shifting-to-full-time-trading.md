# Shifting to full time trading

Let's say your salary is 12 lpa so you are getting 1L per month and wants similar profit from market.
But that's ambitious. So let's plan to reach say 50k profit per month first while continuing your job and once you are comfortably making 50k then move to 1L and think of quitting job to become full time trader.
Option selling is also preferred because you don't need to monitor price action every second. Reviewing your trade in 30 min 1 hour is also fine. Just ensure that stop loss is placed.

Now for stable profits option selling is preferred instead of option buying or trading in futures or cash market.
And option selling requires huge margin. So you need to have a good capital for making 50k or 1L profit a month.

Now for 1L profit per month, that's around 20 trading days so every day you need to make net 5k so as to reach 1L in a month and that's excluding brokerage and tax expenses.

For Option sellers near to expiry is more probability of profit so it comes down to net 25k in each expiry week or 30-35k to compensate for the brokerage and tax expenses.
