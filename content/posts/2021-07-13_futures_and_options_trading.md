## F&O ki Pathshala

### Introduction

In equity market there are two segments, cash market and F&O market (or derivatives).
The difference is settlement in F&O is done in cash, there is no delivery of actual stock. So there is no involvment of actual stock delivery in demat account.

Futures is easy to get started and then one can look forward to options as well.

That's right that there is more risk involved in F&O. Because it is just because of learning curve and high risk involved.
F&O is pure trading and hedging, no investment mindset required here.

Discipline is of utmost importance here.

Futures is initiation of a trade with someone which will be settled at a future date.

Since the cash and F&O segments are different so some brokers offers them as per your trading profile.

In cash market you can trade a single share but in F&O you trade on contracts where each contract is not a single share but a lot of shares. So, 1 lot is the minimum number of shares you must trade. But you don't have to have enough money in demat account, only the margin money is required to enter into that trade.

The date on which trade will be settled is the series expiry and contracts are available for all those series (monthly as well as weekly).

Usually very less traders go for hedging. However, hedging is a really good way to minimize your risks.

Stop Loss is extreamly important. We should ensure that our loss is within the limits which we can bear. It can be price based stop loss that trigger on this price level or it can be money based stop loss that if I have loss of 100 Rs or 10000 Rs than that is enough, need to get off the trade now.

Expiry is of end date of series or contract, after that the next series starts.
Last Thursday is the expiry of each monthly series and each thursday is weekly expiry. If Thursday is holiday than Wednesday is choosen rather than Friday.

Rollover is taking your contract forward from one expiry to next expiry, say if June series is going on then sell the June contract and buy July contract, that's rollover.
Usually if you are in long position and going for rollover then next series is on higher note so you have to pay premium to rollover to next series. But say the next series is having a negative market bias and hence lot's of short positions then you get it in discount instead of premium.
Sometimes Dividend is also announced in next series and hence there is some discount, so some calculations are involved in it.
3 Monthly expiries are always open.

Futures are mainly of two types index futures and stock futures.

Nifty actual levels are usually referred to spot levels.
Nifty Future may have a premium or discount as compared to nifty.

Weekly expiry are only for options, not futures.

On expiry the cost of option will reach zero.
Stock and Index futures are settled at the time of expiry, so whatever price is there in spot that same will be considered as futures price as well.

Market Wide Position Limit - Say if stock distribution is 75% promoter and 25% free float then 20% of that free float that is 5% will be market wide position limit, that's it only.
If stock is in ban then no new position can be opened. Already existing positions will stay intact and need to be squared off. However, fresh intraday positions can still be opened.

### Options Trading -Power of stocks

Options was introduced as an insurance to your portfolio.
Example of a property selling buying scenario to understand premium and psycology of option buyer and seller as well as what is contract.
What is CE PE?
What is Strike Price. In the money/ out of money.

Option buying when you are expecting a fast momentum in your predicted direction.
Option selling will give money when market moves in predicted direction as well as if it remains sideways due to premium decay.

Option buying is limited risk but option selling is unlimited risk theoretically.

## Economic activities around

China hosting Beijing winter olympics wants clear skies so more focus on environment and pollution. Thus clean energy demands and facing power crisis as the infra is not yet in place for fully relying on renewable energy sources. Thus pollutin gindustries like smelters, power plants, textile, chemical units and some food processing units are hit.
Thus lower produciton of goods from China. hence better opportunity for Indian exports.
Higher inflation.

Commodity prices at higher levels.

Apple Testla stopping production at their Chinese facilities.

Chlor-alkali chain chemicals like Caustic soda production is impacted by hurricane IDA strike in US and power shortage in China.
Gujarat Alkalies, Chemplast Sanmar and Meghmani Finechem are likely to benefit from elevated prices for caustic soda.

Acetyl chain chemicals supply from China is also impacted. Can benefit Jubilant Ingrevia, Laxmi Organics, GNFC.
And will have negative impact on adhesive players like Pidilite and Astral Poly as it is a raw material for them.

Atul, Aarti, SRF, Navin Fluorine, Nocil are the favourites to benefit from China plus theme.

Clean green energy theme includes companies like Fine Organics, Clean Science and Technology, Galaxy Surfactants, Divi's Lab.

Electricity shortage in China has benefitted NTPC, Tata Power, Coal India.

Storage and grid stability is the challenge in renewable energy space.

Thermal power plants usually go into maintenance shutdown in rainy season. Poor rain causes higher electricty demand from agriculture sector to fulfill their needs.

China in this energy crisis is clamping down on various tech giants, and areas like gaming, social media.

Increasing oil prices is a risk for indian economy as that can result in INR weakining to 75.5-76 levels
However, Rupee weakning is good for IT companies and other exporters.

## Settlement

For a call optino to be in-the-money, the strike price needs to be LOWER than the market price of the underlying stock.
For a put option to be in-the-money, the strike price needs to be HIGHER than the market price of the underlying stock.

If it is out of money or at the money then whatever premium collected is the net income. No delivery obligations.
If it is in the money then need to take/give delivery to settle it. If there is no delivery which you give to exchange for settlement of your position then it will go into auction and upto 20% loss is possible.

Right and obligation for stocks while right or obligation for index.

Buyer CE | Seller CE | Buyer PE | Seller PE |
Take delivery | Give delivery | Give delivery | Take Delivery |

Index options settlement is by cash and in stock options, settlement is by delivery.

If Nifty 200 PE sold at 10 rs and if it stays abv 200 then PE option will be 0 on expiry and I get 10 rs _ lot size.
If Nifty 300 CE sold at 5 rs and if it stays below 300 then CE option will be 0 on expiry and I get 5 rs _ lot size.

So more chances of winning if you are option seller.

Call option gives the buyer of the call option the right to BUY at the strike price at expiry.
Put option gives the buyer of the put option the right to SELL at the strike price at expiry.
