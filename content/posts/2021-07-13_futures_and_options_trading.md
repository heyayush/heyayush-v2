## F&O ki Pathshala

### Introduction

In equity market there are two segments, cash market and F&O market (or derivatives).
The difference is settlement in F&O is done in cash, there is no delivery of actual stock. So there is no involvment of actual stock delivery in demat account.

Futures is easy to get started and then one can look forward to options as well.

That's right that there is more risk involved in F&O. Because it is just because of learning curve and high risk involved.
F&O is pure trading and hedging, no investment mindset required here.

Discipline is of utmost importance here.

Futures is initiation of a trade with someone which will be settled at a future date.

Since the cash and F&O segments are different so some brokers offers them as per your trading profile.

In cash market you can trade a single share but in F&O you trade on contracts where each contract is not a single share but a lot of shares. So, 1 lot is the minimum number of shares you must trade. But you don't have to have enough money in demat account, only the margin money is required to enter into that trade.

The date on which trade will be settled is the series expiry and contracts are available for all those series (monthly as well as weekly).

Usually very less traders go for hedging. However, hedging is a really good way to minimize your risks.

Stop Loss is extreamly important. We should ensure that our loss is within the limits which we can bear. It can be price based stop loss that trigger on this price level or it can be money based stop loss that if I have loss of 100 Rs or 10000 Rs than that is enough, need to get off the trade now.

Expiry is of end date of series or contract, after that the next series starts.
Last Thursday is the expiry of each monthly series and each thursday is weekly expiry. If Thursday is holiday than Wednesday is choosen rather than Friday.

Rollover is taking your contract forward from one expiry to next expiry, say if June series is going on then sell the June contract and buy July contract, that's rollover.
Usually if you are in long position and going for rollover then next series is on higher note so you have to pay premium to rollover to next series. But say the next series is having a negative market bias and hence lot's of short positions then you get it in discount instead of premium.
Sometimes Dividend is also announced in next series and hence there is some discount, so some calculations are involved in it.
3 Monthly expiries are always open.

Futures are mainly of two types index futures and stock futures.

Nifty actual levels are usually referred to spot levels.
Nifty Future may have a premium or discount as compared to nifty.

Weekly expiry are only for options, not futures.

On expiry the cost of option will reach zero.
Stock and Index futures are settled at the time of expiry, so whatever price is there in spot that same will be considered as futures price as well.

Market Wide Position Limit - Say if stock distribution is 75% promoter and 25% free float then 20% of that free float that is 5% will be market wide position limit, that's it only.
If stock is in ban then no new position can be opened. Already existing positions will stay intact and need to be squared off. However, fresh intraday positions can still be opened.

### Options Trading
Options was introduced as an insurance to your portfolio.
Example of a property selling buying scenario to understand premium and psycology of option buyer and seller as well as what is contract.
What is CE PE?
What is Strike Price. In the money/ out of money.

Option buying when you are expecting a fast momentum in your predicted direction.
Option selling will give money when market moves in predicted direction as well as if it remains sideways due to premium decay.

Option buying is limited risk but option selling is unlimited risk theoretically.

Delta is the value how much premium in ce/pe will increase/decrease if spot price icncrease/decrease by 1 Rs.
So more out of money less is the Delta. and for in the money Delta is close to 1.

Gamma is like d/dx of Delta. So how much Delta changes is called Gamma.

### Intraday stock picking

Need homework a day before. When market closes then in evening you have to study what happened the whole day and analysis all the data of that day.

1. Checkout charts of all the sectors and nifty indices. Note down if any nifty index is breaking above or below yesterday's high or low. So identify the sector and then stock. That is topdown approach.
2. Make a list of stocks to buy or sell if that sector is strong or weak next day.
3. Don't buy gap up or gap down opening. Wait a while for that gap to fill up and then take a trade.
4. Don't be stubborn that at any cost i want to sell or buy a stock.
5. If you were not able to make a decent entry then forget it and move on.
6. I will enter the trade on my conditions or i won't.
7. If you are entering before the breakout then use trailing stoploss and see how long you can ride, but if entering after the breakout then keep strict stoploss at buyprice to avoid loss and book profit soon.
8. First 1 hour of morning, as soon as 5 min candle or a long shadow on 5 min candle is seen, that's the indication of trend reversal.
9. Playing for range bound so contra call at one end of the range but did not have stop loss.
10. Not quick in squaring of positions in put call momentum trades.
11. If breakout in Nifty then doesn't mean you trade with BajFinance hoping that it is high beta and will give better return.
12. Keep all indices open like bank, metals, IT, FMCG to form a better view on Nifty 50.
13. Keep your trading levels ready before the opening bell.
14. Stop Loss should not be just in mind, you need to punch that in system as well.
15. If it was supposed to be intraday then square it off, do not carry losses or you will not have capital to make new trades tomorrow.
16. Don't take all intraday trades in the same sector, diversify them.
17. When market is falling and vix is increasing then probably fall can continue.
18. When market is going up then vix should fall, if vix increases probably the top is reached.
19. When last 1-2 hours market was moving up steeply then premium of PE fall too much for next and CE high so next day if flat opening then sell CE instead of buy PE.

### Candlestick Patterns

Complexity- how many candles are combining to form the paatern.
Types of patterns- Reversal, Continuation, Neutral.

Neutral Patterns

1. Doji

Doji Family-

1. Doji star- Upper and Lower shadow are almost equal, hence completely neutral.
2. Long-Legged Doji- Similar to Doji Star but more longer shadows, hence more volatility.
3. Gravestone Doji- Long upper shadow.
4. Butterfly Doji- Long lower shadow.
5. Four Price Doji- open close high low were all almost same.

Simple Reversal Pattern

1. Hammer - Large lower shadow but then closing in green at high.
2. Inverted Hammer - Large Upper tail but closing in green. So still a reversal but not that strong as Hammer pattern.
3. Shooting Star - Same as inverted hammer but closing in red hence it is bearish reversal while Inverted Hammer is bullish reversal. Shooting star is more powerful then Hanging man.
4. Hnaging Man - Another Bearish reversal, it is similar to Hammer but the candle is red instead of green.

Complex Reversal Patterns

1. Bullish Engulfing.
2. Bearish Engulfing.
3. Piercing Line - First candle is bearish and second is bullish which is piercing the closing value of previous line and closing above it but below the high of previous candle.
4. Dark Cloud - Bearish version of Piercing Line.

# Economic activities around

China hosting Beijing winter olympics wants clear skies so more focus on environment and pollution. Thus clean energy demands and facing power crisis as the infra is not yet in place for fully relying on renewable energy sources. Thus pollutin gindustries like smelters, power plants, textile, chemical units and some food processing units are hit.
Thus lower produciton of goods from China. hence better opportunity for Indian exports.
Higher inflation.

Commodity prices at higher levels.

Apple Testla stopping production at their Chinese facilities.

Chlor-alkali chain chemicals like Caustic soda production is impacted by hurricane IDA strike in US and power shortage in China.
Gujarat Alkalies, Chemplast Sanmar and Meghmani Finechem are likely to benefit from elevated prices for caustic soda.

Acetyl chain chemicals supply from China is also impacted. Can benefit Jubilant Ingrevia, Laxmi Organics, GNFC.
And will have negative impact on adhesive players like Pidilite and Astral Poly as it is a raw material for them.

Atul, Aarti, SRF, Navin Fluorine, Nocil are the favourites to benefit from China plus theme.

Clean green energy theme includes companies like Fine Organics, Clean Science and Technology, Galaxy Surfactants, Divi's Lab.

Electricity shortage in China has benefitted NTPC, Tata Power, Coal India.

Storage and grid stability is the challenge in renewable energy space.

Thermal power plants usually go into maintenance shutdown in rainy season. Poor rain causes higher electricty demand from agriculture sector to fulfill their needs.

China in this energy crisis is clamping down on various tech giants, and areas like gaming, social media.

Increasing oil prices is a risk for indian economy as that can result in INR weakining to 75.5-76 levels
However, Rupee weakning is good for IT companies and other exporters.

# Settlement

For a call optino to be in-the-money, the strike price needs to be LOWER than the market price of the underlying stock.
For a put option to be in-the-money, the strike price needs to be HIGHER than the market price of the underlying stock.

If it is out of money or at the money then whatever premium collected is the net income. No delivery obligations.
If it is in the money then need to take/give delivery to settle it. If there is no delivery which you give to exchange for settlement of your position then it will go into auction and upto 20% loss is possible.

Right and obligation for stocks while right or obligation for index.

Buyer CE      | Seller CE     | Buyer PE      | Seller PE     |
Take delivery | Give delivery | Give delivery | Take Delivery |

Index options settlement is by cash and in stock options, settlement is by delivery.

If Nifty 200 PE sold at 10 rs and if it stays abv 200 then PE option will be 0 on expiry and I get 10 rs _ lot size.
If Nifty 300 CE sold at 5 rs and if it stays below 300 then CE option will be 0 on expiry and I get 5 rs _ lot size.

So more chances of winning if you are option seller.

Call option gives the buyer of the call option the right to BUY at the strike price at expiry.
Put option gives the buyer of the put option the right to SELL at the strike price at expiry.

2022 inflation will be key focus. Companies did not plan for increasing capacity for huge demand revival after covid.
India is a growth story. Young and working population as compared to all over the world.
US holds the control of world economy.

Slowly interest rates might keep on decreasing. Govt all over the worlds are taking debts. So might be moving towards -ve interest rates.

No one is interested in building oil reserves (godowns to store huge quantity of oil).

IT sector contributes a lot in US market but not so much in India yet and is expected to gain more weight.
Metal sector and commodity linked metals may outperform.
Real Estate sector can also grow. Residential as well as commercial both with positive outlook.
Auto sector is underperforming as it is going through a structural change. but as soon as the dark cloud clears then it will outperform.

# Shifting to full time trading

Let's say your salary is 12 lpa so you are getting 1L per month and wants similar profit from market.
But that's ambitious. So let's plan to reach say 50k profit per month first while continuing your job and once you are comfortably making 50k then move to 1L and think of quitting job to become full time trader.
Option selling is also preferred because you don't need to monitor price action every second. Reviewing your trade in 30 min 1 hour is also fine. Just ensure that stop loss is placed.

Now for stable profits option selling is preferred instead of option buying or trading in futures or cash market.
And option selling requires huge margin. So you need to have a good capital for making 50k or 1L profit a month.

Now for 1L a month, that's around 20 trading days so every day you need to make 5k so as to reach 1L in a month and that's apart from brokerage and tax expenses.
