# Data Analysis and IVR

_Speaker - Jyoti Budhia_

Volatility is the rate of measure of the speed at which the price changes.
High IV = High Premiums
Low IV = Low Premiums

Generally IV increases in bearish markets and decreases in bullih markets.

IVR = Implied Volatility Ranking
IVP = Implied Volatility Percentile
IV rank is a measure that brings relativity to implied volatility.

VIX-FIX Indicator
Moves between 0 and 100.
When hovers near 100 or at high levels then market is bottoming and when near 0 then topping sign.

During Long Build up look for Open and Low almost same, so that SL of low is small. Check for highest call open interest and see it is unwinding and puts getting added. Now see if IVR near 100 for confirmation. All check to go long.
During short Build up look for Open and High nearby, because we will put SL on high. Then see if highest put open intrest is unwinding and calls getting added. Now see if IVR near 0 for confirmation and we are ready to short.

# Positional Options spreads

_Speaker - Abhijit Phatak_

## Spreads for monthly expiry.

- Spreads to minimize risks as compared to long options.
- Gapup gapdown has less severe effect.
- Stress free tradeds for monthly expiries so short term volatility does not bother us.

### Credit Spreads

- Ideal under high IV conditions.
- Have higher probability of profit because sideways move is also in our favour.

### Debit Spreads

- Ideal under low IV conditions.
- Need directional move as per our view so as to make profit.

# Intraday Banknifty Options trading via delta drifting.

_Speaker - Shailendra Singh Rajawat_

ATM options have highest time value.
ATM has delta of 0.5 and it increases as you go in the money.

Option Seller's biggest enemy is gamma and best friend is theta.

3 min timeframe of intraday OI change of ATM strike price. Now look for crossovers like CE writers unwinding and PE writers adding. Or PE writers exiting and CE writers adding and then take directional trade.

Diff(PE-CE OI Chg) is also a good indicator.

Nice 3 min candle intraday directional trading strategy.
Set of 4 conditions if they are fulfilling then enter.
