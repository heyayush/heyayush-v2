1. Fakey
   Breakout or Breakdown is fake. Price pierces the crucial level for 1 or 2 candle and then strong candle rejecting that level, thus confirming that it was a fake breakout or breakdown. Strong momentum candle rejecting that breakout or breakdown level is the indicator that it was a false breakout/breakdown.

gapdown hua to aur neeche jayega because

1. Head and shoulder ka breakdown
2. Positive sentiment k baad next din gapdown so aur neeche jana chiye.
   gapup ho kar 34000 k upar sustain kiya aur nifty 15910 k upar then shortcovering

Day's High pe closing ho rhi ho then make close to ATM PE spread with around net 0 credit. So that tomorrow if it is gapup then more chances of profit booking and gap filling or even if it keeps going up still small profit will be there. And if it is gapdown then more chances it will keep going down hence immediately book profit or small loss due to that gapdown with expectation that volatility will increase and our PE sell leg is in loss but PE buy which will become ITM after gapdown will be in good profit resulting in net small profit if it is small gapdown and small loss if it is a big gapdown.

Wed notes
Bank nifty 33.6 k upar aana mushkil h kyuki trapped PE writers square off karte jayenge.

## Trailing SL

1. Price action or Swing wise
2. Point wise or cost to cost wise
3. Indicator wise

In options it is basically about premiums or points collected so for option buyers it is about points traling and exiting cost to cost or in profits.
In option selling we can either go price action/swing wise or point wise.
