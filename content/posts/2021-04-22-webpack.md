Here I am considering webpack version 5.
Bundling all the resources and getting the build ready to serve.
Helps in writing code in modular form and then bundle all of it into a one single file.

Babel transpiler because we want our code to run in older browsers as well.
Difference between compiling and transpiling is compiling is for converting code to different language however transpiling here is converting code to different version of same language so that there is backward compatibility.

```js
module.exports = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    // without additional settings, this will reference .babelrc
                    loader: 'babel-loader'
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

```devtool: 'source-map'```
when in development mode we probably want source-maps so that along with main.js file there is also main.js.map which is a relationship to map between bundled code and individual modules. Thus helping devs to debug.

```webpack --watch``` automatically watch files for update.

```js
devServer: {
    contentBase: './public' //where to look for your stuff
}
```

```webpack serve``` for live reloading. It keeps in memory instead of writing to the output file.

```entry: './src/index.js',```

```js
output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public') // requires an absolute path hence we are using path.resolve
},
```
