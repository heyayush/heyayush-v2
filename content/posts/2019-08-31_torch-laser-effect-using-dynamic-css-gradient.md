CSS offers some really cool features. Here I am showing a torch effect or say laser gun effect and it's really simple to implement with little bit of CSS and javascript.

It's basically changing the background color at your mouse pointer location. And that color change is in circular gradient hence creating a torch like effect.

Here's the [preview](https://css.heyayush.com/hover/Laser-torch/)
