### Intraday stock picking

Need homework a day before. When market closes then in evening you have to study what happened the whole day and analysis all the data of that day.

1. Checkout charts of all the sectors and nifty indices. Note down if any nifty index is breaking above or below yesterday's high or low. So identify the sector and then stock. That is topdown approach.
2. Make a list of stocks to buy or sell if that sector is strong or weak next day.
3. Don't buy gap up or gap down opening. Wait a while for that gap to fill up and then take a trade.
4. Don't be stubborn that at any cost i want to sell or buy a stock.
5. If you were not able to make a decent entry then forget it and move on.
6. I will enter the trade on my conditions or i won't.
7. If you are entering before the breakout then use trailing stoploss and see how long you can ride, but if entering after the breakout then keep strict stoploss at buyprice to avoid loss and book profit soon.
8. First 1 hour of morning, as soon as 5 min candle or a long shadow on 5 min candle is seen, that's the indication of trend reversal.
9. Playing for range bound so contra call at one end of the range but did not have stop loss.
10. Not quick in squaring of positions in put call momentum trades.
11. If breakout in Nifty then doesn't mean you trade with BajFinance hoping that it is high beta and will give better return.
12. Keep all indices open like bank, metals, IT, FMCG to form a better view on Nifty 50.
13. Keep your trading levels ready before the opening bell.
14. Stop Loss should not be just in mind, you need to punch that in system as well.
15. If it was supposed to be intraday then square it off, do not carry losses or you will not have capital to make new trades tomorrow.
16. Don't take all intraday trades in the same sector, diversify them.
17. When market is falling and vix is increasing then probably fall can continue.
18. When market is going up then vix should fall, if vix increases probably the top is reached.
19. When last 1-2 hours market was moving up steeply then premium of PE fall too much for next and CE high so next day if flat opening then sell CE instead of buy PE.
20. If very good closing today (nice bullish daily candle) but tomorrow big gap down then SL will get hit of all the buyers of today and hence tomorrow it can crash down very fast even after that gap down.
21. If it Doji candle today and then tomorrow is gap down then buyers are not trapped hence in that case there might be a recovery after that gap down.
22. Support/Resistance when tested 2nd 3rd time then it is weak and high probability it will be broken.
