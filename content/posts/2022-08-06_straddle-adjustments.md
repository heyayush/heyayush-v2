Straddle often better than strangle when it comes to see MTM losses.

More premium collected earlier, more leverage we have for adjustments.

Monthly straddle with weekly adjustments.

Carryover strategy is to make straddle an ironfly by buying hedges then next morning again remove those hedges. So basically you pay some price for overnight safety against unlimited losses scenario.

Adjustments is basically making your positions delta neutral.

Startegy 1- Going from straddle to strangle by squaring of the losing leg in losses and selling OTM leg on that side.

Strategy 2- Inverted strangle.
