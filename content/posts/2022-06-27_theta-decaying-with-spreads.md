## IV Low

### Credit Spread

### Debit Spread

### Call Ratio Back Spread

- Good if there is some time left in expiry and if up move comes it will be a huge upmove not a small one.
- Good if volatility if low and expectation is volatility will increase along with upward movement.
- If you make this as credit spread then breakeven on higher side is far, thus reducing the profit on upside.
- If you make this as slightly debit spread then more chances of profit on upside and on gapup.
- Good to play this on next expiries instead of current if the view is of positional long rally if upside break out.
- Big gapup is good but flat to negative open will result in losses.
