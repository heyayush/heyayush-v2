## My Plan

There are lots of shorts in the system due to yesterday's move so flat to gapdown opening then keep falling and may break 15800 or 15700 so go ahead with directional CE selling above 16k and keep trailing. But if gapup then will definitely hold 16000 and 34000 and since upside there are lot's of shorts so strangle of 15900-16150 or 34000-34800 will be good.

## Live from the battlefield

Decent gapup then went down to fill the gap and paused for a while on down levels signalling that more lower levels can come. But after 12:00 things changed and call writers got trapped in two big 15 min candles. After that there was no going back. Just a small correction to trap more fresh and existing CE writers from higher levels and then one way upside rally breaking all resistances.

## My execution

Well there was a decent gapup and as per the plan went ahead with strangle. Kept on firefighting in the first half. As the market came down so held my losses in 34100-200 PE and bought CE legs down to 34600-700 as per strangle management, expecting that slowly expiry will be between 34000 and 34500 and there won't be one sided move in second half. But thing went bad and there was huge short-covering, lost all my firefighting profits of 3 hours of morning in just 15 mins and turned to big losses in another 15 mins. So in 30 mins the tables turned. I took SL and got out in huge losses. That was superb SL taking else it could have resulted in irreparable damages. Then once again I got trapped in 35000 CE thinking that ok it broke 34800 but will consolidate here and not break 35000 as just 2 hours are left but no no no. I placed an order of 34500 PE sell at 40 considering that now expiry should be above 345000 and I will recover some of my losses but that limit order was placed at 40 that never get executed and dejected me went for lunch, after that there were hardly any premiums left and morale was down to go long from day's high so just shut down.

## Learnings

- Should have traded in Nifty instead of BN.
- I Had this planned that huge short covering can come at higher levels but should have placed 1:1 stop loss in system instead of manually taking 1:3 due to sharp move in front of eyes.
- Say 12 expiries in a year. 3-4 can be like this and you need to be prepared for them by keeping low SL that ok nothing earned but nothing lost as well.
- Recognize this kind of short covering or long unwinding that it has actually happened and now no going back so take SL and go double quantity on opposite direction or even ITM option buying to compensate your losses.

## My Plan

Gapdown then wait for SC or gapfilling and then sell calls. Sell on rise. After 1 pm SC can come as well if breaks resistance but low chances of long unwinding as there are not much PE writers in the system. SC can come on opening as lots of OTM CE writers they may shift closer to ATM.

## Execution

### Trade 1

Gapdown and then gapfilling happened as planned. So started selling CE. It filled gap and I was increasing CE sell positions. It filled all gap and even went higher to test last swing high. I kept holding losses in hope that it is going as planned that it will fill gap and then go down but it even broke last swing high that's when I squared of my CE shorts, booking heavy losses.

### Trade 2

Top was created and then some bearish candles so I entered again into same 16400 CE sell. Here I made some MTM profits but did not shift my SL to cost to avoid further losses. And market reversed to make new highs thus losses increased.

### Trade 3

Last 2 hours and premiums of both sides were approaching zero and balanced data so I created a strangle. 16400 breached so exited the CE leg of strangle with SL thus more losses that somewhat compensated by PE leg. But good SL taken else losses can be huge. I sold CE at 10 thinking it will go to zero and exited at 20. In the end it closed at 78 so would have been huge loss if did not place SL.

### Opportunity Trade 4

Should have bought 16400 call after all those losses in selling because Nifty sustained over 16400 and there were lots of shorts in the system. And big short covering rally came in the end that I missed. It was anticipated in the data but maybe did not have enough courage left for the day to enter in a trade.

## Learnings

- When lots of OTM calls or puts in the system 1 day before expiry then they will unwind and look to move closer as OTM premium is already eaten. So say if only CE side is having many OTM writing with nearly 0 premium then they will square off and look to move closer thus triggering big short covering. Higher the position sizing bigger can be the short covering. And if it breaks important resistance then even more upside because fresh buying will also come.
- Should not have heavy position deployed since morning if it feels that the expiry can be trending.
- Tight SL is must. Theta decay will not help if market is moving against you.
- Probability of this kind of big short covering increases if the market was falling last few days.
- Vice-versa is the case of long unwinding after a few continues days of rising up.
- If there is some big upcoming event then also short covering or long unwinding chances increases because people will not like to carry positions.
