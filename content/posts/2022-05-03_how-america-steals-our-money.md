# How america sustains

## Dollar

Every year or two we see some country going bankrupt. Somalia, Yemen, Venezuala, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and many such countries currencies is no more valid and is replaced by dollar.

Usually when you hear only and only bad news then for longer term the bottom formation is happening.

USA has more leveraged positions than India hence more margin calls triggered and positions squared off, so more fall as compared to India.
