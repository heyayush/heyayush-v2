1. Stop Loss needs to be placed in the terminal, not just in your mind.
2. Must look at IV before entering an option strategy.
3. Never buy or carry option buying positions at a high IV.
4. In gap downs, option premiums can be insane, IVs can be super high. Do not buy put options in huge gap downs.
5. If you missed a move, you missed a move. Don't join the party late. Wait for next party.
6. Don't assume things are as big as news says, news writers have the tendency to create sensation and big breaking news out of small events as well.
7. If there is some big event scheduled in US tonight for eg Fed meet or GDP data or job data then vix may increase in India and if you are playing for theta decay then it won't be that good.
