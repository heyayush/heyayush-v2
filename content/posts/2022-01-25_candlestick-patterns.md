## Introduction

Complexity- how many candles are combining to form that pattern.
Types of patterns- Reversal, Continuation, Neutral.

### Neutral Patterns

1. Doji

Doji Family-

1. Doji star- Upper and Lower shadow are almost equal, hence completely neutral.
2. Long-Legged Doji- Similar to Doji Star but more longer shadows, hence more volatility.
3. Gravestone Doji- Long upper shadow.
4. Butterfly Doji- Long lower shadow.
5. Four Price Doji- open close high low were all almost same.

### Simple Reversal Pattern

1. Hammer - Large lower shadow but then closing in green at high.
2. Inverted Hammer - Large Upper tail but closing in green. So still a reversal but not that strong as Hammer pattern.
3. Shooting Star - Same as inverted hammer but closing in red hence it is bearish reversal while Inverted Hammer is bullish reversal. Shooting star is more powerful then Hanging man.
4. Hnaging Man - Another Bearish reversal, it is similar to Hammer but the candle is red instead of green.

### Complex Reversal Patterns

1. Bullish Engulfing.
2. Bearish Engulfing.
3. Piercing Line - First candle is bearish and second is bullish which is piercing the closing value of previous line and closing above it but below the high of previous candle.
4. Dark Cloud - Bearish version of Piercing Line.
