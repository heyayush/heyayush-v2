## Introduction

- Option buyer speculates where the market will go. Option Seller speculates where the market will not go.
- Option sellers eat like chicken and shit like Elephants.
- Making strangle you can't go for 1:2 risk to reward when playing out of money.
- Trend is not really your friend because you want market to stay range bound and eat premiums, so breakouts with trend is not actually desired.
- Avoid opening both the CE and PE legs together.
- Enter like a scalper, have SL like a scalper but if trade goes in your favour then have target like a positional along with trailing SL.
- Friday and Monday can be trending as it is start of new weekly expiry and hence not ideal for selling range bound OTM CE and PE options. So a option seller can just do trading on Tue, Wed and Thu.
- Mitigate risk in option selling by deploying only part capital and not full.

## Strategies

### Strangle

### Straddle

- Buying or selling CE & PE of same strike.
- Long or short straddle based upon the volatility expectations.

## Learnings from losses

- When playing with OTM strangles and market reverses and there is big short-covering then one leg can give huge losses. SL is must in that case, do not stay in hope that since I am far OTM I am safe. Option sold at 40 can even reach to 200-250 and on expiry day if it is still OTM then premiums drop to 0 in last hour of expiry but don't stay in trade with that hope. Sold at 40. SL at 70 and exit. It may go to 0 if you hold but that's suicide.
- Most of my losses in strangle are when market reverses in intraday and makes a huge upmove from day's low.
- Always stay hedged, directional positions only when you are certain, and if going for carry forward then hedge is must. Naked carry forwards can be very risky.
- Avoid option selling in first 30 mins of market open. Only use this time to square off carry over positions. Because in first 30 mins premiums get settled after theta decay and gap-up gap-down adjustments.

## Learnings from profits

- Hedged carry forwards of OTM strikes are usually profitable. Even if there is gap up or down then one leg gives profit and other one stays on or near cost so net there is profit, however this depends on how close you are to the expiry.
- Expiry day is supposed to be your most profitable day if considering OTM option selling. So for being a very safe trader just trade on Thu. Also a carry over on Wed for Thu is fine unless a very big gap opening or if the strike price wasn't that far.

### Buying on support

- Do not buy/sell when falling market hits the support for the first time. Usually there is a small bounce from support on first time and then if that support breaks in second time then there is big down move. Similary if it holds support for second time and then breaks the top of previous swing then confirmation of W pattern and big up move.

## General tips

- Always keep an eye on major contributors like Reliance, TCS, INFY, HDFC, HDFC bank, ICICI bank, Bajaj twins.
- Always have the longer trend in the back of your mind and aligning strangles in the directional of that trend can be a more profitable.

## Volatility

- Volatility is your biggest enemy.

## Technicals

- On screen breakouts of crucial levels are more sustainable than gap-up breakouts. Minor gap-up breakouts might be sustained however major levels and if market has already moved up before that breakout than most likely that gap-up will not sustain and gap will be filled. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Muk9bly5
- If some range gets broken after a big time wise consolidation then the moves are also big.
