## Collateral margin

- Stocks, MF and ETF from your holdings can be pledged.
- Collateral margin is the margin received against pledged stocks,ETFs and mutual funds after the haircut deduction.
- Collateral margin can be used for trading Equity Intraday, futures & options writing but not for option buying or take equity positions.
- Exchanges stipulate that for overnight F&O positions, 50% of the margin needs to compulsorily come in cash or cash equivalent collateral, and the remaining 50% can be in terms of non-cash collateral margin .
- So, if you take positions that require a margin of Rs 1 lakh, you will need at least Rs 50,000 in cash irrespective of how much collateral margin you have.
- You will continue to get benefits of all corporate actions like dividends, splits, bonuses, etc. on the stocks you have pledged.
- Haircut deduction is more for stocks, lesser for ETF and least for mutual funds.
- So it best to invest in MF or buy liquid bees, pledge them and then do trading with that collateral margin received.
