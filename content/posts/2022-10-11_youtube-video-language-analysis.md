> Let's analyzing a YouTube video for useful insights using natural language processing.

Jupyter notebooks are perfect for this, so I will directly take you there to see details of implementation with guided notes for each step.

You may directly open it in google colab, follow the instructions, and run all the cells of notebook to see the insights about that video.

Basically we will extract trascript from that video and then use natural language processing methods to get the following:

1. Wordcloud
2. Sentiment analysis
3. Frequency distribution
4. Generate short summary

Hope this was helpful.
Thanks!!
